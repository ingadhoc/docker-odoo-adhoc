## Odoo Docker Compose

This repository contains a set of dockerfiles to build different docker images used by ADHOC.
It also provides a docker-compose file to use odoo in a simple way.

The default odoo docker image (adhoc/odoo-ar) that is used on compose, includes many repositories (and it dependencies) generally used by adhoc (mainly oca and ingadhoc repositories)  

## Requirements

To use this docker compose file need:

* install pip "sudo apt-get install python-pip"
* docker-compose "sudo pip install --upgrade docker-compose"
* docker-engine "sudo curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh"
* we also recommend this so you can use docker without sudo

    * sudo groupadd docker
    * sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker
    * sudo service docker restart && newgrp docker
* clone this repository "git clone git@github.com:ingadhoc/docker-odoo-adhoc.git" (or "git clone https://github.com/ingadhoc/docker-odoo-adhoc.git")
* If you want to have areoo docs convertion you shoud run only once "docker run --name="aeroo" --restart=always -d adhoc/aeroo-docs"


## Run and usefull commands

* Run "docker-compose up"
* Odoo should be ready to be used on http://localhost:8069/
* Check .env for choosing odoo version and other useful configurations
* Remove everything (containers and data) "docker-compose down -v"
